# PWM Robotic Arm

This repository contains the schematics and code for operating a PWM robotic arm using Quartus Lite.

## Description

The PWM robotic arm is designed to have four main components: bicep, wrist, clamp, and elbow. The arm can be controlled using PWM signals to achieve precise movements and perform various tasks.

## Getting Started

To get started with the PWM robotic arm, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/PWM-Robotic-Arm.git`
2. Install Quartus Lite: [Download Quartus Lite](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/software/programmable/quartus-prime/overview.html)
3. Open the Quartus project file located in the repository.
4. Connect the robotic arm to your development board or microcontroller.
5. Build and program the project onto your development board.

## Usage

Once the project is successfully programmed onto your development board, you can control the robotic arm using the provided code. Modify the code as needed to suit your specific requirements.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have any improvements or bug fixes, feel free to submit a pull request. Please ensure that your code follows the coding conventions and is well-documented.
